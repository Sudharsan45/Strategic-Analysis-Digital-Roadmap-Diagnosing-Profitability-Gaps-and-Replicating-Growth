Bharat Herald: Print Decline & Digital Transition Strategy
About the Company

Bharat Herald is a leading national newspaper facing a major transformation challenge in the media industry. Over five years, its print circulation has seen a steep decline, forcing the company to explore digital alternatives while maintaining profitability and brand trust.

Problem Statement

Bharat Herald observed a 60%+ decline in print circulation between 2019 and 2024.
Despite strong readership legacy, low engagement in digital pilots and ineffective marketing allocation created a profitability gap across its city operations.

The company sought a data-driven strategy to:

Identify root causes behind circulation decline.
Quantify engagement and profitability trends.
Recommend actionable steps for recovery through digital transformation.

Objective

To analyze Bharat Heraldâ€™s 5-year operational data (2019â€“2024) and design a profitable digital relaunch strategy using insights from print, ad revenue, and digital readiness metrics.

Data Overview

The dataset includes:

Print Operations: Copies printed, sold, and net circulation.

Ad Revenue: City-level and category-wise revenue.

Digital Readiness Metrics: Literacy rate, smartphone penetration, internet access, and pilot engagement.

Key Insights

A 60%+ drop in print circulation was observed, heavily impacting revenue.

Low Engagement Rate was the key driver behind the lowest Profitability Index across three major cities.

Cities with high digital readiness (smartphone, internet, literacy) had poor engagement in digital pilots, showing untapped potential.

Ad revenue per circulated copy declined consistently post-2021, revealing inefficiencies in the current business model.

Analysis Approach

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover print and ad revenue trends.

Correlation Analysis between engagement rate and profitability index.

City-level segmentation to identify high-readiness but low-engagement markets.

Marketing Reallocation Modeling for digital pilot optimization.

Chat with Data (AI-driven Insights)

Using Python and visualization tools (Power BI / Tableau), an interactive exploration was done:

Q: Which cities should be prioritized for digital relaunch?
A: Top 3 cities with high readiness but low engagement: City A, City B, City C.

Q: Which ad categories are still profitable?
A: Technology, Education, and Local Services maintained steady growth.

Q: Where is print waste highest?
A: Cities with older readership and poor delivery optimization.

Recommendations

Reallocate â‚¹1.2M marketing budget toward high-engagement zones to fund the new digital pilot.

Launch WhatsApp bulletins and mobile-optimized e-papers to boost engagement.

Implement subscription bundles and loyalty programs to regain advertiser trust.

Partner with local influencers and journalists to rebuild digital credibility.

Gradually phase out low-profit print zones and reinvest in high-readiness markets.

Outcome

A targeted data strategy was built to close the profitability gap between top and bottom-tier cities and guide Bharat Heraldâ€™s digital transformation roadmap with measurable, insight-backed decisions.
